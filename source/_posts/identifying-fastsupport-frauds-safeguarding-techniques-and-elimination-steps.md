## What is FastSupport Scam?

FastSupport is a genuine website that lets you access your computer from another location using their GoToAssist program. Even though this is a legitimate website, cybercriminals use it to make money.

GoToAssist lets tech support people look into problems on your computer and fix them remotely.

Unfortunately, scammers often take advantage of it by using it to gain remote access to a user’s computer in order to steal money or infect it with malware.

## How does FastSupport Scam Works?

Cybercriminals send users to fake websites with pop-ups and warning messages that look like real alerts from Microsoft Windows or Apple.

All they want is for you to call the number they give you to fix problems with your computer that don’t exist.

When you call them, that’s when the scam starts. After calling, users are asked to give scammers, who pose as certified technicians, remote access to their computer through FastSupport, LogmeIn, TeamViewer, or another similar service.

Upon connecting, scammers might suggest that there are several problems on your device including a virus infection. To prove it, they might show few errors in the Event viewer log.

Once you are convinced, they will ask for a fee to fix it or do it for free. However, they might install trojans, key loggers, and other malicious software on your computer. 

This might result in loss of confidential information, identity theft and other monetary losses.

## How to Avoid FastSupport Scam?

If you have a suspicion about a message claiming a problem on computer, you have done half the work. Be vigilant and do not click on the link / banner.

As you have not acted upon it yet, your next step is to get rid of those fake messages and warnings. It is a result of adware / scareware on your computer which must be removed. 

Manually removing threats may be a time-consuming and difficult task that needs expert-level computer knowledge. So, we recommend professional antivirus program like TotalAV which can detect and remove all traces of virus infection. It can finish the task for you in just one click.

[Download TotalAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

The best way to keep yourself safe is to know what to do. You need to understand how these cons work and how to spot them. I’ve already explained that above.

If the report about a virus, malware, bug, or anything else has a phone number next to it, do not call it. Instead, go to the [Microsoft Answer Desk](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/) to get real help from Microsoft.
