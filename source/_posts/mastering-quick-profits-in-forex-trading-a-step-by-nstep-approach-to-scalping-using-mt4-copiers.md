## What is Forex Scalping?

[Forex scalping](https://www.babypips.com/learn/forex/scalping) is a trading technique that involves making quick and frequent trades within a single trading day. Unlike long-term investors who aim for significant price movements, scalpers are in pursuit of smaller, short-term price fluctuations. These traders open and close positions rapidly, often within a matter of minutes or even seconds. The primary goal is to accumulate many small profits throughout the day.

## Benefits of Forex Scalping

Forex scalping offers a range of advantages, making it an attractive strategy for many traders:
