## Uninstall using Windows Settings

The easiest method to get rid of McAfee is using Windows inbuilt settings.

1. **Open Settings**  
Open **Settings** by clicking on the Windows icon and selecting settings icon from the menu or search for settings in the search bar.![Go To Settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Go-to-settings.jpg)
2. **Go to Apps**  
In the settings window, look for the **Apps** and click on it.![Apps Interface](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Windows-Apps.png)
3. **Search For McAfee**  
In the list of apps, search for McAfee
4. **You will find numerous apps related to McAfee**  
![McAfee Apps](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/McAfee-Apps.jpg)
5. **Click Uninstall**  
Uninstall each of them one by one by clicking on them and selecting **Uninstall.**![Unistall McAfee](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Unistall-McAfee-1.jpg)
6. **Click Allow**  
After you click on Uninstall, Windows will ask your permission to uninstall the application. When you allow it, you would be taken to McAfee uninstaller, the same interface that installed it.

## Uninstall using McAfee Consumer Product Removal tool

If you are unable to uninstall the McAfee through Windows settings, then you can try McAfee’s official removal tool known as McAfee Consumer Product Removal or MCPR tool. 

1\. Download the latest version of MCPR from [the official site](https://download.mcafee.com/molbin/iss-loc/SupportTools/MCPR/MCPR.exe)of McAfee.

2\. Run it after it gets downloaded, you will notice it does not require installation.

![MCPR McAfee](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MCPR.jpg)

3\. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the uninstallation process to complete. It will take some time, depending on the processing speed of the system.

4\. Once done, the McAfee programs on your system should have gone. If you like to get more information, click on ‘View Logs.’

## Uninstalling McAfee on a Mac

Usually, it is quite easy to remove applications from macOS. However, things are different with McAfee. It is complicated to remove it even on Mac since it does not get uninstalled in the usual way. Here are the steps to do that:

1\. Check whether you are signed in with the Administrator account or not. Of not, then do that.

2\. Open the **Applications** and click on **Utilities Folder**. Look for the **Terminal** and open it.

3\. Now you have to enter a command to uninstall the McAfee from the device. However, the command depends on the version of McAfee you are using. For instance, for McAfee version 4.8 or earlier enter following command:

**sudo /Library/McAfee/cma/uninstall.sh**

And for McAfee version 5.0 and later use the following command:

**sudo /Library/McAfee/cma/scripts/uninstall.sh**

After entering the command according to your version of McAfee, hit Enter

4\. The macOS should remove all the programs and files related to McAfee from your Mac device.

## Final Words

So these are the top solutions to remove McAfee from your device altogether. However, sometimes you may find it difficult to remove it even after using MCPR on Windows and Terminal on Mac. In that case, it is better to get a [good uninstaller](https://www.windowschimp.com/best-uninstaller-software/) to remove McAfee.

Furthermore, we understand that there might be several reasons that have prompted you to get rid of McAfee, but securing your computer is also essential. If you are not satisfied with McAfee, then there are many more [alternative security program](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) options you can go for. Windows Defender is good, but getting a proper antimalware would be more beneficial.

Your hiding McAfee uninstalling tool on your site or it is not longer available. I despise this effort of marketing to avoid removal of your software and it only makes me NEVER to consider your product….this is a poor business model making many of us resent your company and the tactics to make it so difficult to remove a software on products. I will make sure the next purchase of a computer has nothing to do with McAfee.

         Even after following all uninstall procedures McAfee services are still active and taking up memory. On the surface it appears that it has been uninstalled, but if you go to the task manager you will find that it is alive and well, just not readily seen.

   I didn’t buy or install McAfee. It’s like a virus. I never wanted it and I never use it. I believe it came in on an update. I’m like others here, I tried every piece of advise to get rid of it. It is interfering with my internet connection and I constantly have to reboot.

This worked perfectly for me! So grateful – it was taking up an incredible amount of memory, and every time I closed it from running in the background it would pop right back up. My new Lenovo i5 laptop was running at an obnoxiously slow space – I stopped using it all together after a few months of growing frustration.  
Thank you again for the walk through. I was able to uninstall the multiple downloads from McAfee and now my laptop is running like a champ!! So happy!
