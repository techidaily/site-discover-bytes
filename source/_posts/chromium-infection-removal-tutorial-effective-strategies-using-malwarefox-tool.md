## What is Chromium?

Chromium is an open-source web browser project created by Google, and the browser build by compiling its codes is known as Chromium browser. Google started the Chromium project in 2008, and since then, it has become the base for many popular browsers. The two most popular browsers of the internet world – Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are based on Chromium Engine. Other big chromium-based browsers are – Opera, Brave, and Vivaldi.

## What is Chromium Virus?

It is essential to know that Chromium is itself a legitimate web browser. However, because of its open-source nature, cybercriminals are regularly maliciously using Chromium as a medium to spread their ill-disposed codes to thousands of systems. Since Chromium is an open-source project, its source code is readily and freely available on the internet for everyone to use. Cyberattackers modify Chromium’s code to inject their malware and spread it through various means.

This maliciously modified version of Chromium that harms the user’s system in many ways is popularly known as Chromium Virus. It is a form of the [Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP)](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/).

## Signs that Chromium Virus is on your System

When the malicious Chromium browser enters your system, you will notice some unusual changes happening automatically that will indicate the virus’s presence. Here is the list of some indications that confirm the infiltration of the Chromium virus.

1. You will notice the Chromium browser on the desktop that got installed automatically.
2. The default web browser is changed to Chromium.
3. There is some illegitimate search engine set as the default.
4. You see a lot of advertisements while browsing the internet.
5. The system becomes slow and sluggish.
6. The other browser you are using is hijacked, and settings are modified to promote fake search engines and web pages.

## How to remove Chromium Virus from the PC?

If you experience all or some of the signs mentioned in the previous section, your system is infected with an illegal Chromium browser. The Chromium virus usually enters your device after a browser hijacker takes control of your browser’s settings. 

To remove the Chromium virus, you have to first catch and remove the culprit browser hijacker, which is the root cause, and then remove the Chromium, 

For that follow these steps:

### **Restart your PC in Safe Mode**

Windows Safe Mode is the perfect environment to find out and solve the critical errors in the system. In safe mode, only system programs and some crucial programs run. Safe mode would most likely kill the applications and files that try to run automatically on your system. Follow this guide to boot your Windows 10 PC in [**Safe Mode**](https://www.windowschimp.com/how-to-boot-windows-10-into-safe-mode/)**.**

### **Remove Web Extensions From Browser**

You might have accidentally installed a malicious browser web extension that is responsible for the infected Chromium download.

If you have many web extensions installed in your Chrome browser, it is time to sort them out and at least disable, if not delete, the ones you rarely use. However, you must remove the useless web extensions instead of disabling them. Because, even after disabling them, they might use the CPU processing power while checking for updates and performing updates.

Here are the steps to manage the web extensions on the Chrome Browser:

1. Click on the three dots at the top-right corner.
2. Bring mouse cursor over **More tools** and from the extended menu choose **Extensions**.![Extensions settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Extensions-settings.png)
3. All the extensions would be on your screen
4. Look for the ones you want to disable or remove.![manage chrome extensions](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/manage-chrome-extensions.jpg)
